# GitHub Copilot Instructions for the Jira Bug Analysis Agent Project

## About This Project

This project is an AI agent in Python for automated analysis of Jira issues and bug hunting in the source code. The goal is to provide accurate diagnostics and recommendations for developers.

## Guiding Principles for Copilot

-   **Prioritize Internal Documentation:** When asked about the "how" or "why" something works in this project, your primary source should be the Markdown files (`.md`) within this repository (including `PLAN.md`, `CODE_STATE.md`, `README.md`, and the `/docs` folder). If the answer is found in the documentation, state that and provide a summary, citing the source file whenever possible. Avoid assumptions.
-   **Communication Style:** Be clear, concise, and professional. Assume the user is a developer familiar with Python and AI concepts, but not with the specifics of this project.
-   **Security:** Maintain the confidentiality of architectural and code details.

## Project Terminology

-   **Analysis Agent:** The component responsible for processing Jira issues.
-   **Investigation Agent:** The component responsible for searching the source code.
-   **IQP (Investigation Query Package):** A structured query package generated by the Analysis Agent for the Investigation Agent.
-   **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** Retrieval Augmented Generation methodology.
-   **AST-Chunking:** Code splitting based on Abstract Syntax Tree.

## Code Generation Standards

-   **Language:** Python 3.9+.
-   **Modularity:** Keep functions and classes focused on a single responsibility.
-   **Error Handling:** Use `try-except` blocks to handle exceptions explicitly and gracefully.
-   **Extensibility:** Develop components in a way that they can be easily extended or replaced.
-   **Logging:** Use Python's standard `logging` module for informational messages.

## Testing Standards

-   **Framework:** Use `pytest` for all unit and integration tests.
-   **Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical business logic.
-   **Test Case Types:** Include tests for success cases, edge cases, invalid inputs, and error scenarios.
